##  What I Learned

Some of the key things I learned include:

- Creating **issues and milestones** in GitHub to plan my work
- Using **branches** to work on features separately
- Writing clear **commit messages** and referencing issues 
- Creating and managing **pull requests** before merging code
- Keeping track of project progress using GitHub Projects
