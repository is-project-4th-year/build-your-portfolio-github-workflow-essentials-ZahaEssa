## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

1. **Creating Issues and Milestones in GitHub:**  
   I learned how to break down my work into small tasks using issues and group them under milestones to plan and track my progress effectively.

2. **Using Branches to Work on Features Separately:**  
   I learned to create separate branches for each feature, which helps avoid conflicts and keeps the main code clean and stable.

3. **Writing Clear Commit Messages and Referencing Issues:**  
   I learned to write short and clear commit messages that describe what I changed, and to link them to issues to keep everything connected and easy to understand.

4. **Creating and Managing Pull Requests Before Merging Code:**  
   I learned how to use pull requests to review code changes before merging, which improves code quality.
